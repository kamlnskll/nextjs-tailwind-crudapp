# nextjs-tailwind-crudapp

This very basic CRUD app uses NextJS and TailwindCSS to add/remove/edit employees to a list. At the moment, this is all the app is intended to do but I will add more features as I complete the original basic design. 

Some ideas for the future include a basic authentication, use of NextJS SSR, multiple pages and anything else I might incorporate into the project.
